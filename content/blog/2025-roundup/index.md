We're back again. Typing up a viral sensation - this website still has no analytics, still no evidence and is still deeply committed to plausible deniability. Putting down the cultural breadcomes that destracts me from the slow, constant realisation that adulthood is mostly just admin and going for walks. 

This year has felt like a geniuine "progress year", the kind people on LinkedIn describe with alarming, bright-eyed fervour, beginning with the tedious phrase “Here’s what I learned from X” and ending with some heroic metaphor that collapses under even the gentlest scrutiny. Still: progress all the same.

Outside the 925, most of my energy has been poured into the ongoing project of improving bricks and mortar in south-east London. Last year I wrote this sitting beside a half opened toilet; this year I’m writing from a study, looking out over south-east London, smug as someone who casually mentions cold plunges, a person I once mocked and have now become. Over the course of the year, we said goodbye to the pebble dashing, survived the loft extension and now have a completed kitchen and bathroom - luxuries after 12 months of an airfryer and a camping stove with 1 working hob. We're still living amind lingering chaos in the living and dining room and a first floor that looks like the scene of heinous crimes but honestly at this point I'm emotionally attached to having at least one room in a constant state of 'nearly there'. 

Work also had a year. edyn.care grew 70% and won a Care Award, which sounds impressive — and it is — but the credit belongs to the team. I’m mostly just hovering nearby, keeping the wheels vaguely attached, occasionally asking annoying questions in meetings, and trying not to break anything important.

And then there’s the wider world, still beautifully complex and, frankly, unhinged. But our individual lives, when you strip away the noise, remain remarkably simple. Don’t be a dick. Be there for family and friends. Don’t get hypnotised by the macro when the micro is right there in front of you. Focus on what you can touch, fix, and love.

Anyways. Here’s the 2025 cultural roundup. Same format as before: deeply personal, borderline unnecessary, and offered with the full knowledge that nobody asked for it. Bring on 2026. 💪


#### Music:

I'm happy report that music listening continues to be central to day-to-day existence. In 2025 45,438 minutes of the good stuff was consumed - a 23% increase on last year. I organised and logged my records like the organised adult I sometimes pretend to be, added a few new bits to the collection, and even spent some time in Logic making electronic music of my own. None of it is suitable for public consumption - not because it's too avantgarde but because it's pretty awful - but it’s given me an enormous amount of joy, which is basically the whole point. There’s been a shift in my morning routine too: NTS Radio has become the default wake-up companion, which means Radio 4 has been banished to the bin. (I still love you, Amol Rajan — this isn’t personal, it’s just not working anymore).

Anyways. Here’s what I’ve been listening to.

Spotify playlists: [Music for dancing: Disco | House | Afro 🪩](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1NjeJFtVOYHr4z9zO6LSXx?si=41d934146c8c4cf6) /  - If you have any dance floor belters lmk. 


Standout tracks/bands/albums are:

- Annahstasia - Tether. A debut Album that arrives feeling like it's been around for years. Her voice is a middle ground between Nina Somone and Grace Jones. Listen to the whole thing. Don't skip. Let the end of Believer take you away. 

- Olivia Dean - The Art of Loving. I've found this album quietly addictive. A smash hit pop album which isn't over produced and lets her voice act as the anchor. 

- Lightnin' Hopkins - Mojo Hand. Music at it's true essence from the 60s - put a genius in a room and press record!

- Dave - The Boy Who Played the Harp. An honest album in which Dave is interrogating his identity, his success and pressures that come with that. "Chapter 16" with Kano feels like a torch being handed over. 

- Everything is Recorded ft Sampha, Laura Groves - My and Me. A gem from XL Recordings label boss Richard Russell.

- Svanebord Kardyb - Cycles. 2 mates making beautiful music. 

- Lucrecia Dalt, David Sylvian - cosa rara. Any fans of Tom Waits will enjoy. 

- Milton Nascimento - Francisco. No words actually spoken but so much said in this truly overwhelming song. 

- MF DOOM - Licorice. I can't not have Doom on here. I've spent some time digginging into his prodution album Special herbs vol. Any Dooms fans who haven’t read Ta-Nehisi Coates article spending a few days with DOOM need to check it out [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/21/the-mask-of-doom). ALL CAPS. I also read the Biograph by S.H Fernando Jr this year, more on this below.   



#### Restaurants/5:
- The French House: 4.6/5 - A favourite this year! I highly recommend getting the chococlate & rum mousse it's sensational. 
- Dory's 4.6/5 - A Margate must for seafood by beach.
- St John: 4.5/5 - Nuff said.  
- Kinneuchar Inn 4.3/5 - The Fried Chicken Sandwich is worth the Monday queue. 
- Chubby Dumplings 4.5/5 - A Brockley market staple which acts as a comforting Sat am treat.
- Fallow 4/5 - A bday treat. I can't remember much but was good.  
- A Wong 2.5 - Like it's obviously good but is it worth the outlay? I'm not sure. 


#### Podcasts:

- The Go to Food Podcast - Great foodie gossip and restaurant recommendations from London's best chefs. A good place to start is Phil Howard's ep - the chef who worked under Marco Pierre White and opened The Square which went onto garner 2 Michelin Stars and now runs Elystan Street. 

- Test Match Special - A long comforting audio blanket. Test cricket serves as a good reminder to slow down and appreciate small things like did a small circular item flying through the air swing more in the am or pm. 

- Adrift - How a family survived being stranded in the Pacific for 38 days with amazing sound design woven in. 

- The A to Z of David Bowie - Obviously.

- The Screen Rot Podcast - The romance from 2023/24 continues. Up the rotters!

#### Books:

- S.H Fernando Jr - The Chronicles of DOOM: Unraveling Rap's Masked Iconoclast. A meticulously reasearched book which demonstrates the masks wasn't just an asethetic flex - it was a philosophy and the freedom to create without being consumed by celebrity. Part biography, part love letter. A Must for any DOOM fan. 
- George Elliot - Middlemarch. I haven't finished it yet but I've fallen in love with it. It's as good as everyone says. It’s a 900-page psychological X-ray of human behaviour as relevant as it was then as it is today.
