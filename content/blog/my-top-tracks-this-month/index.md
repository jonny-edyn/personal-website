description: "A rolling list of what I’ve been listening to, powered by the Spotify API. A fun little project. If you find a banger, you’re welcome."

This started as a fun little experiment messing around with Codex (OpenAI’s coding agent) to see how quickly I could get something real working. I used it as a jumping-off point to wire up the Spotify API, pull in my recent listening history, and render it live on the page when the right environment variables are set. Hope you enjoy the list, and shout if you discover a new banger from it.
