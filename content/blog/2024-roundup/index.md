Let the annual self indulgence commence. Following on from last years rip-roaring roundup, I‚Äôm attacking the keys again for my 2024 round-up of my year in music, films, podcasts and books (etc etc). As always, let me know if you‚Äôve got some suggestions. 2024 was a year that had some big life events - I lived in a different city for 3 months, I got on the property ladder (Catford/Honor Oak represent) and saddled myself with perpetual debt, I have a four legged friend called Glenn, yet the year doesn‚Äôt seem too seismic - I guess the peaks and troughs of life are quite hard to grasp when one is living in a renovation and currently has a toilet in his living room. Bring on 2025 üí™

#### Music:

I‚Äôve listen to a lot of music in 2024 (36,937 minutes in total - thanks Spotify for your data crunching). Podcast continue to be staple in my day-to-day. I‚Äôve given up on audiobooks, they just don‚Äôt register and I prefer the tangible thing. Creating monthly playlists continues:
