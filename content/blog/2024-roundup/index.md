Let the annual self-indulgence commence! Following on from last year's rumoured rip-roaring success (unfortunately, I don't have analytics set up on this website, so I can neither confirm nor deny), Iâ€™m attacking the keys again for my 2024 round-up of my year in music, films, podcasts, and books (etc., etc.).

2024 was a year of big life events: I lived in a different country for three months (admittedly the next country up from England), got on the property ladder with my girlfriend (Catford/Honor Oak represent), and saddled ourselves with perpetual debt. We also welcomed a four-legged friend called Glenn. Yet the year doesnâ€™t seem too seismicâ€”I guess the peaks and troughs of life are quite hard to grasp when one is living in a renovation that currently has a toilet half-opened in its living room. Anyways, let me know if youâ€™ve got some suggestions. Bring on 2025! ðŸ’ª

#### Music:

I'm happy to say Iâ€™ve listened to a lot of music in 2024 (36,937 minutes). Admittedly about 50% of this was going through Bob Dylan's arduous back catalogue to ensure I secure the top 0.5% of listeners again in 2024 but I persist for Bob. The Podcast continues to be staple in my day-to-day but Iâ€™ve given up on audio books, they just donâ€™t register and I can never find the spot I actually stopped listening and started day dreaming - I'm sure a well trodden path.

Standout tracks/bands/albums are:

- Mary Wallopers - The Holy Ground. An Irish folk band who are best live act Iâ€™ve seen. I went and saw them in Manchester for my birthday and it was a lively gathering. A real celebration of unity brought to a crescendo with the first 3 chords of Eileen Og. Go on, check it out!

- Kanye West - never Ye, always Kanye. I always see Kanye in three parts. 1. A complicated human going through a lot without an effective support mechanism around him. 2. A reasonable rapper. 3. An incredible producer. But after a long conversation with a friend, during which they argued he's the artist of our generation, I returned and on reflection he's right, he's got to be up there. 

- MF DOOM - My love for DOOM deepened this year leading to me purchasing my first bit of DOOM merch - a cereal bowl and a figurine which were quite possibly my favourite acquisitions. From last years round up, any Dooms fans who havenâ€™t read Ta-Nehisi Coates article spending a few days with Doom need to check it out [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/21/the-mask-of-doom). ALL CAPS. 

- Fontaines D.C - hard to not listen to them this year. They have been everywhere. I haven't dived in too deep, so far and just centred attention on Favourite. I'm excited to get into older catalogue. 

- Whitney - Forever Turned Around. 

- Aretha Franklin - What A Fool Believes.

- Nina Simone - I Shall Be Released.

- Tarren - Hardwood.

- Tom Yorke - Dawn Chorus (this song has got me back into making electronic music. More to come in 2025)

#### Restaurants/5:
- Timberyard: 4.7/5
- Kudu Grill: 2.5/5
- The Devonshire: 3/5
- Saka Maka: 4.5/5 


#### Podcasts:

- The Go to Food Podcast - Great foodie gossip and restaurant recommendations from London's best chefs. A good place to start is Phil Howard's ep - the chef who worked under Marco Pierre White and opened The Square which went onto garner 2 Michelin Stars and now runs Elystan Street. 

- This Past Weekend w/Theo Von - Anyone who wishes to understand how Trump won just listen. 

- The Rest is History - Yes itâ€™s the best podcast from Goalhanger mafia. 

- Prof G Markets  - Scott Galloway explains the stock market like a grumpy uncle who is very aware of his boomer luck. Expect life advice, occasional rants about billionaires, and enough economic jargon to make you pretend you understood it all.

- The 404 Media Podcast - If you find tech scary then don't listen. It makes it all scarier. 4 ex vice investigative journalists bring to light stories on cyber security, AI, consumer rights and surveillance. An audio Black Mirror but it's reality. 

- Bad Friends - Bobby Lee's and Andrew Santino's dysfunctional comedy podcast which is what I imagine a large family Christmas dinner is like - lots of people talking over each other with no real agreement on conversation theme but good times all round.

- The Screen Rot Podcast - last years romance continues. Up the rotters! 


#### Top TV:

- The Traitors - The betrayal, the deception, the herd mentality and the flawed logic it's all gold with Claudia holding it down as the driving force throughout.  

- One Day - I watched this in Edinburgh (where it is based/filmed). An odd experience to be walking the streets you watched on the box the same day. That said, the series did David Nicholls' novel justice and Ambika Mod's performance was breathtaking.

- The Responder - A British police drama created by a former Merseyside Police officer. The series offers a gritty portrayal of the challenges faced by front-line police officers in Liverpool.

- The Outlaws - BBCâ€™s best comedy in years. It really does make you realise that Stephen Merchant was instrumental in the success of The Office - essentially tapering down Gervais to bring out the humanity. 

- Clarksonâ€™s Farm - How Jeremy Clarkson has managed to pivot from Top Gear and his problematic Times column to the nations figure head on agriculture is nothing short of PR genius/terrifying. 


#### Top Movies:

- The Zone of Interest 
- The Anatomy of a Fall
- Howls Moving Castle
- The Outfit
- Killers of the Flower Moon 
- Poor Things
- The Wolfpack 
- The lost daughter
- Chef


#### Books:

- Nuclear War: A scenario - Anne Jacobsen. If there's one thing you take from reading this guff, please be it finding out about this book. It's incredible! In summary, it's a minute-by-minute hypothetical scenario of a nuclear conflict initiated by a surprise attack from North Korea on the United States, leading to a catastrophic global nuclear war. My generation has never really had to grapple with "Einstein's Monsters" and the cyclical and self-perpetuating logic inherent in nuclear deterrence strategies. However, this book really brings it home and it's worth spending some time with. 

- Exponential: Order and Chaos in an Age of Accelerating Technology - Azeem Azhar

- Politics on the Edge: A memoir from within - Rory Stewart

- How Britain Really works: Understanding the Ideas and Institutions - Stig Abell

- Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly - Anthony Bourdain

#### Comedy/Gigs:

- The Mary Wallopers
- Bloc Party
- Nils Frahm
- Ahir Shah
- MC Hammersmith
- Glenn Moore
- Tim Key 
- Paul Foot

#### Board games:

- Codenames
- Listography
- Linky

#### Places

Here are a few of the places that bought joy to my year: 

- Edinburgh - 3 months living up in Scotland was a dream start to the year. 
- Blythe Hill Festival - community event in the park at the end of the road. Thatcher's hell. 
- Lords Cricket - Eng vs Sri Lanka. Root becoming England's all time top run scorer. 
- La Cadiere dâ€™azur, France - A week away with Natalia and Gregoire (ello mate!)
- Prague & Dresden - A weekend get away to celebrate Claire's bday and see Nils Fram 
- Manchester - A night out on canal street with Marc.
- Copenhagen - A Ryan family adventure to support Karis complete her Hyrox event which she absolutely nailed!
